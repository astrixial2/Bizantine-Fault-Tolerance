	abstract = {<p>A major assumption underlies the correctness of BFT services: failure independence. However, state of the art protocols rely on inter-replica communication in order to preserve consistency, and they implicitly require replicas to store access information about each other. This jeopardizes the independence of failure assumption since intruders can sneak from one replica to another and compromises the entire service. In this paper, we leverage this issue by exploring the idea of obfuscation in the BFT context: the replicas of a BFT service are completely unaware of each others identities. We present a new client-based replication BFT protocol, called OBFT, that assumes honest, but possibly crash-prone clients. The protocol imposes equivalent load on replicas to avoid bottlenecks, and reduces the load on the primary replica by distributing multi-cast and cryptographic tasks among clients. We evaluate OBFT on an Emulab cluster with a wide area topology and convey its scalability with respect to state of the art BFT protocols.</p>

abstract="State machine replication, or ``consensus'', is a central abstraction for distributed systems where a set of nodes seek to agree on an ever-growing, linearly-ordered log. In this paper, we propose a practical new paradigm called Thunderella for achieving state machine replication by combining a fast, asynchronous path with a (slow) synchronous ``fall-back'' path (which only gets executed if something goes wrong); as a consequence, we get simple state machine replications that essentially are as robust as the best synchronous protocols, yet ``optimistically'' (if a super majority of the players are honest), the protocol ``instantly'' confirms transactions.",

abstract="In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of BChain, a Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication protocol, which performs comparably to other modern protocols in fault-free cases, but in the face of failures can also quickly recover its steady state performance. Building on chain replication, BChain achieves high throughput and low latency under high client load. At the core of BChain is an efficient Byzantine failure detection mechanism called re-chaining, where faulty replicas are placed out of harm's way at the end of the chain, until they can be replaced. Our experimental evaluation confirms our performance expectations for both fault-free and failure scenarios. We also use BChain to implement an NFS service, and show that its performance overhead, with and without failures, is low, both compared to unreplicated NFS and other BFT implementations.",

abstract="Our increasing dependence on complex and critical information infrastructures and the emerging threat of sophisticated attacks, ask for extended efforts to ensure the correctness and security of these systems. Byzantine fault-tolerant state-machine replication (BFT-SMR) provides a way to harden such systems. It ensures that they maintain correctness and availability in an application-agnostic way, provided that the replication protocol is correct and at least {\$}{\$}n-f{\$}{\$}n-fout of n replicas survive arbitrary faults. This paper presents Velisarios, a logic-of-events based framework implemented in Coq, which we developed to implement and reason about BFT-SMR protocols. As a case study, we present the first machine-checked proof of a crucial safety property of an implementation of the area's reference protocol: PBFT.",
